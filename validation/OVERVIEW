FORTUNA VALIDATION
==================

The `fortunad` server has been validated against three random number
testing utilities:

1. rngtest: FIPS 140-2 (errata of 2001-10-10) tests
   source: http://packages.debian.org/source/sid/rng-tools
2. dieharder: a random number generator testing suite
   source: http://www.phy.duke.edu/~rgb/General/dieharder.php
3. sts: NIST statistical test suite (NIST SP 800-22rev1a)
   source: http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/ST/toolkit/rng/index.html


RESULTS
=======

rngtest: PASS
dieharder: PASS
sts: PASS


TESTING
=======

rngtest: netcat is used to pipe RNG output directly to the binary. A
minimum of 2500 bytes is required for each block, and 1024 blocks are
tested (the test consumed 20480032 bits total, or 2560004 bytes).

dieharder: netcat is used to pipe RNG output directly to the binary.


See MANIFEST for a list of the output files.
